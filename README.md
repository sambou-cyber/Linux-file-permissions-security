# Linux File Permissions & Access Control

# Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Linux command-line tools to examine and manage file and directory permissions in a security-focused scenario. The objective was to ensure that only authorized users had access to sensitive research files by correcting permission misconfigurations.

The project highlights practical authorization management and the application of the principle of least privilege in a Linux environment.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Linux file and directory permission analysis
- Access control and authorization management
- Use of `ls -la` to inspect permissions
- Use of `chmod` to modify file and directory access
- Handling hidden files securely
- Applying least privilege principles

## Tools & Commands
- Linux (Bash)
- `ls -la`
- `chmod`
- File ownership and permission strings

## Project Files
- **file-permissions-report.pdf** – Detailed report including commands, explanations, and embedded screenshots demonstrating hands-on execution

## Key Security Concepts
- Least privilege
- Authorization vs authentication
